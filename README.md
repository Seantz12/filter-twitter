# filter-twitter
An automatic filtering of posts that you're not interested in

So far all it does is filter posts without images or videos, because I'm not browsing internet for text, I'm browsing it for art.

May look into doing things like

* Only images! Aka by deleting even the text captions
* If we're super cool, maybe even classification of images!

Problems:

* Find a way to not delete the "show new things"
* The options page is ugly
* also i think the options loading in doesn't work properly on first load
