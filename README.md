# filter-twitter
An automatic filtering of posts that you're not interested in

So far all it does is filter posts without images or videos, because I'm not browsing twitter for text, I'm browsing it for art.

May look into doing things like

* Only images! Aka by deleting even the text captions
* If we're super cool, maybe even classification of images!
* Maybe hide tweets with image, then click to show? might be better flow wise?

Problems:

* The options page is ugly
* Bit stutery, not sure if good way to fix that
* If the hidden tweet is a reply tweet, makes the next tweet look like a reply
